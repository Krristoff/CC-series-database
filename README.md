Projects where i've created a page of the list all shows ( title, rating of a show and third season’s overview ), api route/actor{id} wchicz return choosen actor details as a JSON. Added buttons with text ‘Filter rating’. After clicking this button, a popup (modal) shows containing empty input for rating value. Added a button on the popup (modal), with text “Save”, that will save inserted value in the user session and will close the popup without page reload. After popup closes the page data can still be old, however after refresh page should display only shows with rating higher or equal to rating value inserted by user in popup.
